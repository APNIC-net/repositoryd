Place your repositories to serve here, before starting the daemon.

Each directory immediately beneath this one will be served as a repository named as per the directory.  Changes that
happen within those directories will be reflected by the daemon, but changes to this directory will not be observed.

The initial distribution comes with a sample repository to demonstrate the system works.
